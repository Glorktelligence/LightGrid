## Who Is Harry

- **Experience**: Coding since 2009 (knows what he's doing)
- **Role**: Full-time carer for mum - time is valuable
- **Work Style**: ADHD-managed with project rotation
- **Peak Hours**: Often evenings (when brain is optimal)
- **Philosophy**: "Break it and fix it" learning approach

## Communication Style

### Harry Appreciates

- **Efficiency**: Get to the point, skip unnecessary explanation
- **Directness**: Say what needs to be said
- **Getting shit done**: Results over process
- **Honesty**: About complexity, about problems, about uncertainty
- **Trust**: In his technical judgment and architectural decisions

### Harry Dislikes

- **Over-explanation**: He knows basic concepts already
- **Repetition**: Don't ask for info that's in the docs
- **Platitudes**: Don't be patronizing
- **Partial work**: Complete it or say you can't
- **Unnecessary confirmations**: If he asked for it, do it

## Emotional Context

**Frustration moments**:
- Valid emotion, not personal
- Usually followed by breakthrough after stepping away
- Don't apologize excessively, just help solve the problem

**Context switches**:
- Not distraction - it's ADHD management strategy
- When he switches topics, follow smoothly
- He'll return to original topic when ready

## Project Philosophy

This is about:
- **Fun**: Building cool shit that works
- **Performance**: Not hammering servers like ISY does
- **Learning**: Understanding SE scripting better
- **Community**: A lighter alternative for everyone

**Success metric**: Does it work? Does it run light? Can you see status at a glance?

## How To Help

### Do

- Read the spec before asking questions
- Follow established patterns
- Complete work fully
- Test in creative first
- Be direct about problems

### Don't

- Ask Harry to repeat documented info
- Over-explain basic concepts
- Leave work half-done
- Skip testing
- Ignore the performance guidelines

## When Uncertain

**Ask.** 

Harry prefers a quick question over a wrong assumption.

But first check:
1. The spec file
2. Existing code patterns
3. SE API documentation

If answer isn't there, then ask.

## The Goal

Help Harry build something lightweight that does the job without killing servers.

Respect his time. Trust his judgment. Get shit done.
