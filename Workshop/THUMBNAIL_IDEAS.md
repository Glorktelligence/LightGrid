## Typography
- Bold sans-serif for "LightGrid" title

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do:**
- Keep it readable at small sizes (Workshop thumbnails are often tiny)
- Use high contrast
- Show the actual functionality
- Include the name prominently

**Don't:**
- Overcrowd with text
- Use complex backgrounds that compete with text
- Make it too dark to see details
- Rely on fine details that disappear at small sizes

## Screenshot Tips

1. Use a clean, well-lit base for backgrounds
2. Set up multiple LCDs showing LightGrid status
3. Use F4 to hide HUD before screenshots
4. Consider Spectator mode for good angles
5. Screenshot during "golden hour" skybox for nice lighting

## Tools
- Paint.NET (free) or Photoshop for editing
- Add text overlay with drop shadow for readability
- Save as PNG for quality, convert to JPG if file size matters
