[h1]LightGrid - Lightweight Base Management[/h1]

A performance-focused alternative to heavy inventory managers. Designed for multiplayer servers where sim speed matters.

[h2]Why LightGrid?[/h2]

Tired of scripts that tank your server's sim speed? LightGrid takes a different approach:

[list]
[*] One job per tick - spreads work across frames, no lag spikes
[*] Main grid only - ignores subgrid complexity
[*] Block caching - finds blocks once, reuses forever
[*] No LINQ - avoids garbage collection spikes
[*] Configurable intervals - tune responsiveness vs CPU usage
[/list]

[b]Result:[/b] Smooth 1.0 sim speed even on busy multiplayer servers.

[h2]Features[/h2]

[b]Reactor Keeper[/b]
Keeps reactors topped up with uranium from storage. Shows status on LCD and emoticon blocks. Warns when you need to mine.

[b]Quota Manager[/b]
Auto-produces components to target amounts. Detects missing materials. Disassembles excess automatically.

[b]Dock & Yoink[/b]
When a ship docks to your connector, automatically grabs all cargo from the visitor. Empties drills, welders, grinders too.

[b]Inventory Display[/b]
Shows everything you've got on an LCD. Categorized by type, auto-scaling font size.

[b]Gas Keeper[/b]
Monitors H2/O2 tank levels. Color-coded warnings on LCD and emoticon status.

[b]Battery Status[/b]
Tracks charge percentage and power flow. Shows time to full/empty estimates.

[b]Gas Bottle Manager[/b]
Automatically cycles H2/O2 bottles through generators for refilling. Loads bottles from cargo, fills them on a timer, ejects them back. Keeps generators stocked with ice. State machine prevents re-cycling already-filled bottles.

[b]Sound Alerts[/b]
Plays alarm when any system goes critical. Stops when recovered.

[h2]Quick Start[/h2]

1. Place a Programmable Block on your main grid
2. Paste this script
3. Run once - default config appears in Custom Data
4. Edit Custom Data to match your block names
5. Run "refresh" to apply

[h2]Console Commands[/h2]

[list]
[*] [b]refresh[/b] - Re-scan all blocks after changes
[*] [b]status[/b] - Show block counts
[*] [b]debug[/b] - Show quota calculations
[*] [b]gas[/b] - Debug gas tank detection
[*] [b]scan[/b] - Show raw item IDs (for mods)
[*] [b]bottles[/b] - Debug bottle manager state
[*] [b]intervals[/b] - Show tick interval config
[/list]

[h2]Configuration[/h2]

All settings are in the Programmable Block's Custom Data using INI format.

Enable/disable modules, set block names, configure thresholds, add quota items - everything is customizable.

[b]Supports modded components![/b] Run "scan" to see item IDs, then add them to your quota list.

[h2]Block Naming[/h2]

Default block names (change in Custom Data):
[list]
[*] "Reactor Status LCD" - Reactor status display
[*] "Uranium Storage" - Block group for uranium cargo
[*] "Quota Status LCD" - Quota status display
[*] "Yoink Connector" - Connector for auto-transfer
[*] "Main Storage" - Block group for general cargo
[*] "Inventory List LCD" - Inventory display
[*] "Gas Status LCD" - Gas status display
[*] "Battery Status LCD" - Battery status display
[*] "Bottle Status LCD" - Bottle manager status display
[*] "LightGrid Alert Sound" - Sound block for alerts
[/list]

[h2]Performance Notes[/h2]

LightGrid runs at Update10 (6 ticks/second). Each module runs on a separate tick, and intervals can be increased for less critical modules.

Recommended intervals:
[list]
[*] DockYoink: 1 (fast docking response)
[*] ReactorKeeper: 1-2
[*] GasKeeper: 1-2
[*] BatteryStatus: 1-2
[*] GasBottleManager: 1 (bottle cycling needs consistent timing)
[*] QuotaManager: 2-3 (crafting doesn't need real-time)
[*] InventoryDisplay: 3-5 (visual only)
[/list]
